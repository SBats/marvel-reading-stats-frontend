# Marvel Unlimited Stats - frontend
Frontend for stats about your marvel ultimate readings !

**This project is currently under heavy developments**

## Roadmap
* Allow filtering in library & Merge library and collection ???
* Use [marvel-unlimited-stats-backend](https://github.com/SBats/marvel-reading-stats-backend) instead of marvel API. (This will quickly be needed as the 3000 call/day limit of the API will be an issue regarding the amount of content)

## Prerequisite
You will need node >= 5 and npm >= 3 in order to make this project work.

## Installation
* `npm install`

## Development
* `npm run start` - launch dev server and files watch

## Building
* `npm run build` - build app for distribution
